# FIUCClasswork
This is classwork involving the C language that I have currently finished for my systems programming class and for future classes that may use C. For the class I used PuTTY, mobaXterm as my terminals and WinSCP for SFTP. I have overwritten the Makefile each time I zipped up my assignments to turn in so the Makefile will only be included for the most recent assignment I have finished. All code works unless otherwise stated.

Recently realized this is not setup name wise with my other classes. COP4610 is my operating systems class and code related to assignments from it. Assignments not in a folder are from COP4338 Systems Programming.
